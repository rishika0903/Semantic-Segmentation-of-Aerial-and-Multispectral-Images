# Semantic-Segmentation-of-Aerial-and-Multispectral-Images
This project focuses on semantic segmentation of both aerial imagery and multispectral images, leveraging deep learning models to classify each pixel into specific land cover or object categories (e.g., buildings, roads, vegetation, vehicles, etc.).
